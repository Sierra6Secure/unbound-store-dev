description: >-
  A validating, caching DNS forwarder configured exclusively for DNS over TLS (DoT).


  By running Unbound on your Umbrel with this specific configuration, your DNS queries are wrapped in a secure TLS tunnel before leaving your network. This prevents your ISP or local attackers from snooping on your browsing habits or hijacking your DNS requests.

  
  Key Features:
    - Protocol: Operates as a "Caching Forwarder" using DNS over TLS (DoT) for maximum privacy.

    - Security: Enforces encrypted communication via Port 853 to trusted upstream providers (Cloudflare/Quad9).

    - Privacy: Employs forward-tls-upstream: yes and forward-first: no to ensure that if an encrypted connection cannot be established, the system will never fall back to an unsecure, cleartext query.

    - Validation: Supports DNSSEC to ensure the integrity of the records received, protecting you from "spoofing" attacks.

    - Integration: Perfectly optimized to serve as the upstream resolver for Pi-hole, creating a complete ad-blocking and privacy-hardened pipeline.

releaseNotes: >-

  1.0: UI Release

    🖥️ NEW MANAGEMENT UI
  
    - Dynamic Configuration: Manage upstream DNS and custom settings via the Sierra6 dashboard.
  
    - Container Control: Integrated logic for automated restarts and configuration hot-swaps.
  
    - Safety System: Added a 'Revert to Default' feature to prevent accidental lockouts.



    🛡️ SECURITY HARDENING
  
    - DoT Enforcement: Mandatory Port 853 encryption with 'forward-tls-upstream: yes'.
  
    - Leak Prevention: Set 'forward-first: no' to strictly block unencrypted fallback.
  
    - DNSSEC: Enabled hardware-accelerated signature validation to prevent spoofing.



    🗺️ Roadmap
    
    - Performance Metrics: Real-time graphs for cache hit rates and latency.

    - Certificate Management: Enhanced UI for private enterprise-grade TLS certs.

     -Automated Backups: One-click export for disaster recovery.
